He didn't know the term "social media" and Facebook was something not even dreamed of in Buck Rogers cartoons. And yet his lessons remain relevant for everyone who communicates online today. In fact, with problems such as cyber bullying and email etiquette, we need Carnegie's help more than ever. Dale Carnegie and Associates, Inc. has re-imagined Carnegie's lasting lessons for this difficult digital age, reframing Carnegie's insights about communication, self-expression, and leadership. This book is a must-have guide for anyone who wants to find success on Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, and any social media format today and in the future.},
